# CMSE 822 Group Quest 1: The Path to Peak Performance

## Setting

In this Quest, you will join the legendary Profilers' Guild, tasked with guiding the ancient code of Agoge through a labyrinth of memory-bound dungeons and compute-bound trials to achieve ultimate speed.

## Group Member Roles

First thing upon accepting this assignment, specify who will be the project coordinator (PC), the documentation lead (DL), and the group spokesperson (GS) for this project. The PC will be responsible for setting group meetings and ensuring that all aspects of the project are addressed equitably amongst the group. The DL will be responsible for ensuring that the project report is prepared according to the requirements and that all prompts are explicitly and clearly addressed. The GS will be responsible for giving a short presentation in class on the group's work upon completion of the project.

**Project Coordinator (PC):** Navigator

**Documentation Lead (DL):** Lorekeeper

**Group Spokesperson (GS):** Bard 

## Learning Objectives

- Develop collaborative skills using GitHub.
- Gain familiarity with using HPCC.
- Understand concepts of arithmetic intensity and memory hierarchies. 
- Understand how to interpret a roofline model and use it to estimate performance.
- Understand the basic kernel types (dwarfs) for computational science. 
- Gain experience using Intel VTune for performance analysis.

## Project Description

1. clone Agoge?
2. Compile and run it on HPCC to verify you can
3. for each subunit of agoge, run unit tests with varied problem size, then estimate big-O scaling.
4. Use integration test with Intel VTune to profile the code.
5. Produce a roofline. Pay attention to architecture.
6. Tune your problem setup and compiler settings to make MANA (maximum arithmetic and numerical acceleration).

## Deliverables

1. **Code Repository**: A GitHub repository containing all project code and documentation.
2. **Final Report**: A detailed report explaining the problem, methodology, results, and conclusions.
3. **Presentation**: A presentation summarizing the project and findings.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Code Quality: Readability, organization, and documentation.
- Methodology: Appropriateness and correctness of the computational methods used.
- Results: Accuracy and significance of the results obtained.
- Collaboration: Effective use of version control and teamwork.
- Presentation: Clarity and thoroughness of the final report and presentation.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Group formation and project proposal.
- **Week 2-4**: Development and implementation.
- **Week 5**: Testing and validation.
- **Week 6**: Final report and presentation preparation.
- **Week 7**: Submission and presentations.
